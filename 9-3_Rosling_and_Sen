# What is the difference between the 1st and 3rd world in Hans Roslingâ€™s presentation in terms of preconceived notions and reality?

1st world countries tend to have smaller families and larger life expectancies. However, the 1st and 3rd world are not as
different as many believe. As due to improvements in health and technology, although developing countries are in different positions,
developing countries are catching up.

# What appears to be a precursor of wealth and what type of endeavors are healthcare aand education?

Health and education are prerequisites to wealth. In order for one to have the freedom to pursue a job,
one must be healthy. And being educated opens up the door to new opportunities. As rosling showed, countries with
healthier people tended to have higher rates of development.

and the inability to be healthy.

Who were Say and Malthus and what were their ideas and who do you think is ultimately right?#

Malthus was an economist that said population growth is unsustainable and that society will ultimately collapse. 
Say was an economist that believed that fetrtility rates would lower as wealth increases. Malthus thought that 
fertility rates would stay up as long as there are resources to support it. However, as history has shown, as
people get wealthier and more educated family size gets smaller so I belive that say was right.
