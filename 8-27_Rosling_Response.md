  Hans Rosling’s TED talk The best stats you’ve ever seen shines a light on the modern
day misconceptions of the developing world and provides good evidence of the importance
of accessibility and representation of data in reaching beneficial outcomes for developing
countries. I was pleasantly surprised to learn about the big strides that the world has made
in the context of global development and the fact that this was a surprise  highlights
Rosling’s point that there should not be a generalized “us versus them” approach when
characterizing developing countries. Rosling’s data demonstrate that the developing world
has more nuance to it than people believe. His data on family size, income distribution, and
life expectancy is important for researchers to understand to further human development,
especially because it can demonstrate factors besides wealth that are important for development.
  
  Rosling showcased the importance of health and technology to development. His data showed
that health is more indicative of faster rates of development than wealth is and that access
to technology such as computers correlated strongly with development as well. I agree with
his statement that not all developing countries should be treated the same. Rosling made a
good point when he showed that his data indicated that not all of Africa is the same by
comparing the different economies and health outcomes of African nations.  More people
need to start thinking about developing countries in this more nuanced context.

  Furthermore, Rosling’s presentation also reinforced in me the importance of effective data
visualization. Rosling’s claims were surprising to his audience and the interactive visualization
he made really drove his point home. The key takeaway is that researchers have to take a more
customized approach to human development  and accessible understandable data is important to that.
