**Topic Proposal**

If a person is sick or disabled and does not have access to adequate healthcare, then they are unable to go out to work or find work, they might be unable to take care of their children, they might result to self-medicating with illegally attained and potentially dangerous drugs, and their lives could very well end early. Health is a prerequisite to living and therefore a prerequisite to the development of human life. That is why my research topic is about the utility of geospatial data science methods to providing beneficial health outcomes in the developing world. Most of my sources so far examine regions in Sub-Saharan Africa, however, for this initial research I did not focus too much on a specific region yet because I wanted to explore the different applications of data science in health care first. Given how important health is for human development, simulations of human development in the context of healthcare could provide essential benefits.

This article&#39;s objective was to explore if categorical data, in the form of treatment-seeking behavior, can be used to predict disease treatment in developing countries. Treatment-seeking behavior describes a person&#39;s attempts to get formal healthcare to mitigate or treat their illness. Treatment-seeking behavior is important to ensuring that disease does not spread in developing countries. However, it is difficult to quantify in a way that it applies to all communities because it is affected by multiple economic and demographic factors that vary greatly in developing communities. Therefore treatment-seeking behavior is not analyzed often as a predictor while it could prove useful to expanding access to healthcare in the developing world. To address this issue, the researchers used Bayesian models to use categorical treatment-seeking behavior to perform a continuous probabilistic estimate of fever treatment in Namibia. The dataset they used was a nationally representative Namibian household survey from the 2013 Demographic and Health Survey. They discretized the individual level treatment-seeking responses by using their geographic data to connect them to estimates of travel-time to the nearest healthcare facility and then fitted their Bayesian models with Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations to predict the probability of fever treatment for children five years old and under. The models found that individuals that are far away from healthcare facilities have a 30% chance of seeking treatment and that those that are closer are more probable to exhibit healthier behaviors. This article demonstrates the importance that probabilistic data science models have to discretizing categorical variables that would otherwise be difficult to use in developing countries and turning them into a valuable asset for prediction. It addresses the sustainable development goal of ensuring that people live long and be healthy by examining geographical data to investigate if the distance from healthcare facilities is indicative of people actually receiving treatment. Furthermore, this article relates well to Amartya Sen&#39;s definition of human development as it indicates that people need the freedom to access healthcare in order to live well. The research noted that their methodology can be extended to other categorical behaviors from survey data and to other illnesses which proves well for future application.

Dotse-Gborgbortsi, W., Dwomoh, D., Alegana, V., Hill, A., Tatem, A. J., &amp; Wright, J. (2020). The influence of distance and quality on utilization of birthing services at health facilities in Eastern Region, Ghana. _BMJ Global Health,_ _4_(Suppl 5). doi:10.1136/bmjgh-2019- 002020

This article sought to discretize data on the distance and quality of healthcare treatment centers to analyze their effect on the use of birthing services in the Eastern region of Ghana. Maternal mortality rates are especially concerning in developing countries and attendance at skilled birthing services being the best way to prevent them. The researchers notice a gap in research that uses healthcare data to analyze distance and healthcare quality&#39;s effect on child birthing service use in developing countries. Therefore, they used a spatial interaction model and routine birth data, obstetric care surveys, and geospatial data on the health facility locations to use socioeconomic and demographic characteristics to model movement patterns of pregnant individuals in the Eastern region of Ghana. This article used four data sets for its study: HMIS records of hospital-based births from Ghana&#39;s District Health Information Management Systems 2, a gridded map layer of estimated pregnancy for 2015 from the HMIS to attain the locations of the healthcare facilities, and a nationally representative sample survey of emergency obstetric and newborn care to measure healthcare quality. They used WorldPop to fit their spatial interaction model and produce maps that modeled the movement patterns. The study found that as little ass a kilometer increase in distance from a healthcare facility has a significant effect on the prevalence of women using birthing services—it reduced the rate by 6.7%, that women in rural areas travel on average four kilometers more to reach their nearest healthcare facility, and that 56% bypassed their nearest healthcare facility. This article highlights the importance of placing healthcare facilities closer to populations in developing countries by demonstrating how much access to quality healthcare would be improved if people had to travel less for it and were aware of where to get it. Monitoring people&#39;s travel patterns to healthcare facilities is useful to ensuring that everyone can have access to quality healthcare. This is especially important in the context of Amartya Sen&#39;s definition of human development that development comes from the elimination of unfreedom because lack of access to quality healthcare often leaves people trapped by the confines of their circumstances.
